# Tinkered MST Project

### Program
program for Tinkered MST Project in DBLab of catholic university.

### Problem Statement
This paper proposes a solution to the problem of finding MST for a given set of many terminals considering optimized time on a Euclidean plane.  
This project assumes an environment in which each MST given within several partitions.
When the number of Terminals is large enough, it takes a considerable amount of time to get an MST. Therefore, using the information given to the environment, we propose a method of obtaining optimized answers in a faster time and similar to MST.

### Algorithm
Proceed in the following order:

The purpose of this program is to optimize the connection between each partition in a short time.  

### Paper
* vol1: Optimize the connection between each partition in a short time.  
* vol2: Same as vol1, the component(interconnection) within each partition changes in real time.
